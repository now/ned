\title{Abstract}


This manuscript presents a survey of the theoretical foundations of regular
expressions and text editors.  A thourough introduction to the subjects of
symbols, languages, grammars, regular expressions, finite automata, character
sets (\Unicode), pattern matching, and the inner and outer workings of a text
editor is given.

The knowledge contained in this survey is then put to good use in presenting a
method of compiling regular expressions into efficient finite automata that are
well suited for pattern matching tasks in a text editor.  The usefulness of
pattern matching inside a text editor is also shown, by describing the
command sets of modern text editors, such as \SAM\ and \cap{vim}.

Finally, a pattern||matching library has been written that can be used in, for
example, a text editor.  A library implementing an efficient data structure for
representing sequences has also been written.  Both these libraries have been
used to create an example text editor that uses the pattern||matching library
in implementing its command set and the data||structure library in
implementing its buffering strategy.  All pieces of software have been
documented using a literate programming style of writing and are included in
this manuscript for reference.
